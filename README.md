# Java_Inventory_System
A inventory system that is made with Java that preforms CRUD operations. 


A JavaFX graphical program that simulates an inventory management system can add, modify, and delete parts and products while also incorporating parts into products. Users will not be able to delete products if parts are associated with the product.  The program also has logical safeguards just in case users errors.
